## API

This API is available if the node is running public http-access. Set the constant HTTP_PUBLIC_PORT (for the period of the test run - November 2018 this constant is the name HTTP_HOSTING_PORT)

#### Getting the current status of the blockchain
http://194.1.237.94:80/GetCurrentInfo?Diagram=0

Result:
* MaxNumBlockDB - the maximum block number stored in the database (the current height of the blockchain)
* CurBlockNum - new block to create
* MaxAccID - the current maximum invoice number
* MaxDappsID  - current maximum Dapp number
* VersionNum - version of the program on which the node works


An example of the result:
```
